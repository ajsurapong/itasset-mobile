-Make sure you have already directory android/app/src/main/assets/, if not create directory, after that create new file and save as index.android.bundle and put your file in like this android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle
At project folder
-react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res/
-cd android 
-gradlew assembleDebug
